# ImCurr
An absolutely free tool to encrypt/decrypt files or groups of them

### Relevant versions (2.06.2018): 0.7, 0.6

## 0.7 version release!
#### Download [here](https://github.com/IngeniousA/ImCurr/releases/tag/0.7.0)
#### Changelog:
- New **inject/eject** function that can inject one file stealthy into another one. The best thing is that it's really stealthy. It's so stealthy that file-recipient's size doesn't even change! *(It actually does, but none of OS can detect it)* And of course you can eject the information back.
- Fixed bugs

## 0.6 version release!
#### Download [here](https://github.com/IngeniousA/ImCurr/releases/tag/0.6.0)
#### Changelog:
- Now using **Blowfish** algorithm instead of my own, which makes protection way **powerful**
- Increased **safe** file size from 1 Kb *(0.5)* / 4.2Gb *(0.6-beta1)* to **UNLIMITED**!
- Improved **GUI** by simplifying it
- Decreased encryption/decryption time. Now it takes <15 sec to **fully** encrypt a 128Mb file

##### Note. You can't:
##### - decrypt files with ImCurr **0.5**, which were encrypted with ImCurr **0.2.1** - **0.4.1.1**
