# ImCurr
Simple tool to hide and recover messages in files, including file corruption and ressurection.

## 0.3 version release!
#### Changelog:
- **Cut** all features except file decryption/encryption
- Improved **file encryption**: now you must set the **password** to the encrypted file to protect it from hacking
- **Auto mode**. You don't have to remember the size of a segment if you turn on Auto Mode. Program will divide and shuffle segments automatically. However:
  a. You still need to remember encryption password
 Â b. You can't decrypt file without knowing segment size if it was encrypted in non-automatic mode.

Note. You can't decrypt files with ImCurr **0.3**, which were encrypted with ImCurr **0.2.1**
